## 1. Rendering

- Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
  . Render on the server `for every request`
  . Use `getInitialProps` or `getServerSideProps`

- Static Site Generation (SSG)
  . Render `at build time`
  . Use `getStaticProps`

- Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
  . Hybrid approach where static pages are `pre-rendered at build time` (like SSG) and
  `regenerated after a specific time interval`
  . Use `getStaticProps` with `revalidate` prop

## 2. File-based Routing

## 3. API Routes

## 4. Automatic Code Splitting

- Only loads the JavaScript necessary for the page being viewed

## 5. Optimized Image Handling

- Served in modern formats like WebP
- Lazy-loaded to improve performance

## 6. Built-in CSS and Sass Support
