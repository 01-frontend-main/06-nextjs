## 1. Multi Types of Rendering

- Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
  . Render pages on the server `for every request`

- Static Site Generation (SSG)
  . Render pages `at build time`

- Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
  . Hybrid approach where static pages are `pre-rendered at build time` (like SSG) and `regenerated after a specific time interval`

## 2. File-based Routing

## 3. API Routes
