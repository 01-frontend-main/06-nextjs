## Image Optimization

- Extends the HTML <img> element with features
  . `Size Optimization`: Automatically `serve correctly sized images` for each device, using modern image formats like `WebP` and `AVIF`.
  . `Visual Stability`: `Prevent layout shift` automatically when images are loading
  . `Faster Page Loads`: Images are `only loaded` when they `enter the viewport`, with optional blur-up placeholders
  . `Asset Flexibility`: On-demand `image resizing`, even for images stored on remote servers
