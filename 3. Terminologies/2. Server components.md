## Server Components

- Allow you to write UI that can be `rendered and cached` on the `server`
- Able to use `async` in function components

## Benefits of Server Rendering

- `Security`
  . Server Components allow you to `keep sensitive data and logic` on the `server`,

- `Caching`
  . By rendering on the server, the result can be `cached and reused` on `subsequent requests` and `across users`

- `SEO`
  . The rendered HTML can be `used by search engine bots` to index your pages

- `Performance`
  . Allow users to `view the page immediately`, `without waiting` for the client to `download, parse and execute the JavaScript` needed
