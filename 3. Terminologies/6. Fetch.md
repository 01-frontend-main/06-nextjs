## Fetch

- Next.js `extends the Web fetch() API` to allow each request on the server to `set its own persistent caching` and `revalidation semantics`

## Caching options

- `auto no cache` (default):
  . Next.js fetches the resource from the remote server on `every request in development`, but will `fetch once during next build`

- `no-store`
  . fetches the resource from the remote server `on every request`, even if Dynamic APIs are not detected on the route

- `force-cache`
  . If there is `a match` and `it is fresh`, it will be `returned from the cache`
  . If there is `no match` or a `stale match`, Next.js will `fetch the resource from the remote server` and `update the cache` with the downloaded resource
